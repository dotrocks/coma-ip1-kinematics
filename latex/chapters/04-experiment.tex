\section{Projectile Shot In An Area With Air Resistance}
With air resistance in mind, we canâ€™t easily make calculations of the movement. For this purpose, we have made 4 different projectile shots and tried to make calculations according to their movement. 

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
      & $15^{\circ}$        & $30^{\circ}$       & $45^{\circ}$       & $50^{\circ}$         \\ \hline
    L & 100.21 cm & 97.41 cm & 58.25 cm & 58.13 cm   \\ \hline
    H & 3.56 cm   & 7.96 cm  & 9.43 cm  & 11.75 cm   \\ \hline
    $v_0$ & $367 \frac{cm}{s}$  & $312 \frac{cm}{s}$ & $322 \frac{cm}{s}$ & $366.2 \frac{cm}{s}$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Projectile Shot With Air Resistance}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mass of the projectile: $2.7g$
    \item Average acceleration: $424 \frac{cm}{s^2}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent Due to air resistance, rolling motion of the projectile and other factors, real results are different from the theoretical results. Both $L$ and $H$ is much smaller than is should be because of these factors.
