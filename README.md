# Integrated Project#1 - Kinematics

Project files for the first integrated project of the COMA Capsule at Abdullah Gül University, Fall 2023.

In this experiment, we are trying to calculate movement of a basic projectile shot in an ideal area with no friction or other factors and try to find out what is the difference between this ideal area and the real life and derive a function/matrix from those experiments.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

1. **MATH153 & PHYS105**: Theoretical and experimental calculations of projectile motion.
2. **MATH103**: Mathematical modeling of the projectile motion using matrices and vectors.
3. **EE101**: Solving matrices using C++
